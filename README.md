# Project Overview

## Description

This project comprises the following components:

- **Ilyes_REZGUI_Dataset.csv**:
  This file represents the dataset used in the project. Note that the dataset was generated through a process of source code representation using an embedding model.

- **Ilyes_REZGUI_KNN_K-means.ipynb**:
  This Jupyter Notebook contains the implementation and comparative analysis between the KNN classifier and the K-Means clustering method before and after applying dimensionality reduction (PCA).
  It is structured as follows:

  1. **Importing Necessary Libraries**
  2. **Dataset and Preprocessing**
  3. **K Nearest Neighbors**
     - Case where K=2
       - 3.1: Training Phase
       - 3.2: Overall Evaluation Phase
       - 3.3: Evaluation Phase by Pattern
     - Case where K=10
       - 3.1: Training Phase
       - 3.2: Overall Evaluation Phase
       - 3.3: Evaluation Phase by Pattern
  4. **K Means: Clustering**
     - 4.1: Training Phase
     - 4.2: Visualization Before PCA
     - 4.3: Visualization After PCA
  5. **Comparative Analysis Between KNN and K-Means**

## Usage

To use the provided files:

1. Download `Ilyes_REZGUI_Dataset.csv`.
2. Open `Ilyes_REZGUI_KNN_K-means.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Follow the structured sections for implementation and analysis.
